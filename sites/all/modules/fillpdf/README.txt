Installation
------------

This module requires one of several external PDF manipulation tools. You can:

   1. Deploy locally -- You'll need VPS or a dedicated server so you can deploy PHP/JavaBridge on Tomcat or a similar servlet container, or
   2. Sign up for Fill PDF Service, and plug your API key into /admin/settings/fillpdf
   3. Install pdftk on your server and have that be used for PDF manipulation
